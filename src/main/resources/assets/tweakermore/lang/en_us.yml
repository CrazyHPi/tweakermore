        When performing creative pick block action (middle click) with hotkey pressed,
        store the target block's block state into the nbt named "BlockStateTag" of the picked item.

        Skip the session finalization operation of xaero's worldmap when quit a world
        So no lag when quitting server or single player
        Might have some side effects though
